# Predict-Future-Sales

This is a predictive machine learning project using Python based on Kaggle competition: Predict Future Sales

In this competition, a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data, is provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. We are provided with daily sales data for each store-item combination, but our task is to predict total sales for every product and store in the next upcoming month.
